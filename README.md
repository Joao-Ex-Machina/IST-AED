## Summary
  Study repository for the Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados course (post-MEPP 2021/2022). No unedited files will be added here, so in order to be able to generate the executable be sure to have all libraries and dependencies (They can be found at the [AED Course page](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/AED/2021-2022/1-semestre))
## Code of Academic Honesty
  This is a study repository. We trust our pairs and future LEEC and IST students not to copy our code during evaluations.
  Apart from this specific case all code in this repository is completly Libre, as stated in the License
## Special Thanks
This was probably one of my favorite Curricular Units I attended at Instituto Superior Técnico.\
Therefore I would like to publicly thank Prof. Carlos Bispo, Prof. João Ascenso and Prof. Luís Silveira in this repository.\
Their teachings really boosted my interest in Procedure Oriented Programming, Computer Systems and Algorithms.
